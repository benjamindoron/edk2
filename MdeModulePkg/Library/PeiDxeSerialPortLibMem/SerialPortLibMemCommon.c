  Write data from buffer to serial device.

  If the return value is less than NumberOfBytes, then the write operation failed.

                            On output, the value actually set.
  @param ReveiveFifoDepth   The requested depth of the FIFO on the receive side of the
                            serial interface. A ReceiveFifoDepth value of 0 will use
                            the device's default FIFO depth.
